# LaTeX ROBOMECH Template

This package improves the LaTeX compatibility of the Robotics and Mechatronics Conference (ROBOMECH) template for less painful manuscript preparation.

The template has been edited to be used with modern collaborative tools such as [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) by removing all pLaTeX dependencies from the official template files of ROBOMECH 2017 found at [http://robomech.org/2017/en/papersubmit/](http://robomech.org/2017/en/papersubmit/). The modifications have been kept to a minimum.

The current version has been confirmed to work with the following tools (using the LuaLaTeX compiler):
* ShareLaTeX: [https://www.sharelatex.com/](https://www.sharelatex.com/)
* Overleaf: [https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/)

This work could not have been done without the help of the following packages:
* BXjscls: [https://github.com/zr-tex8r/BXjscls](https://github.com/zr-tex8r/BXjscls)
* LuaTeX-ja: [https://www.ctan.org/pkg/luatexja?lang=en](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/luatexja?lang=en)
